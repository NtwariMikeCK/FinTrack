# FinTrack
Mission and Focus:
Our mission for the Fintrack project is to empower individuals, especially students and young adults, with effective financial management tools. We recognize that personal finances can be challenging, and our goal is to simplify the process, promote financial awareness, and encourage responsible spending.
